# ✨ Contributing Guidelines  

We welcome all contributions, including pull requests, bug reports, and discussions. Thank you for helping improve **PLUTUS Pair-Trading Toolkit**!

## 📜 Code of Conduct  

Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). **All contributors are expected to follow it.** Any inappropriate behavior or violations will not be tolerated.  

## ❓ How to Get Help  

See our [Support Guide](SUPPORT.md). **Do not** use GitHub issues for general questions—ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead.  

## 🐞 Bug Reports & Issues  



### 🏁 DO 

✅ **Check the documentation & Support Guide** before opening an issue.  

✅ **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.  

✅ **Provide clear details**—steps to reproduce, error logs, expected vs. actual behavior.  

✅ **Use Markdown formatting** (wrap code in triple backticks ` ``` `).  


### ⛔ DON'T 

❌ Open duplicate issues.

❌ Comment "+1"—use GitHub reactions instead.  


## 💡 Feature Requests  

- Clearly describe the problem your feature solves.  
- Explain why it's useful for others.  
- If possible, outline a potential implementation.  
- **Avoid feature creep**—we prioritize core functionality.  

## 🚀 Submitting Pull Requests  

Before submitting a PR:  

✔ **Open an issue first** (for large changes).  

✔ **Keep PRs small**—one bug fix or feature per PR.  

✔ **Follow existing coding styles**.  

✔ **Include tests and update documentation** if necessary.  

✔ **Ensure CI checks pass before requesting review**.  


### 🔄 PR Workflow  

| Step                 | Action Required |
|----------------------|----------------|
| 📝 Open Issue       | Discuss the problem/feature first. |
| 🏗️ Fork & Code    | Follow project structure, add tests. |
| 📑 Create PR       | Provide a **clear description**. |
| 🔍 Code Review     | Address comments & improve PR. |
| ✅ Merge & Release | After approval, maintainers merge it. |


### 📝 Writing Commit Messages  

**Follow these commit message rules:**  

✔ **Use the imperative mood** → ("Fix crash", **not** "Fixed crash").  
✔ **Keep subject under 50 chars**, and wrap body at 72 chars.  
✔ **Explain _why_ the change is needed**, not just what it does.  
✔ **Prefix relevant component** → (e.g., `[docs]`, `[data_generations]`, `[stationarity_tests]`).
