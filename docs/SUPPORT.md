# 📣 Support and Help

Need help getting started or using the project? Here's how.

## 🚑 How to Get Help

For general usage questions that are not specific to the project itself, please search for answers on Stack Overflow. This is the best way to get help quickly and allows others to benefit from shared knowledge.

We recommend seeking support in the following ways:

➊ 📖 **Read the Documentation & Guides.** Before asking for help, check the documentation and guides for solutions. Hands-on experience is the best way to learn! We’re rooting for you! 👏

➋ 🔍 **Search & Ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).** If you're troubleshooting an issue or trying to use the project in a specific way, search existing questions or ask new ones on Stack Overflow.

➌ 💬 **Join Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fPg7vbnCTR) Community.** We don’t provide direct “customer support,” but we are happy to engage in discussions, answer questions, and chat about best practices. We’ll try our best to respond, but please be patient! 🐌

➍ ✍️ Open a GitHub Issue (**Last Resort!**)


If you believe you’ve found a bug or need help that only the maintainers can provide, open a GitHub issue. When doing so:

1. ✅ Clearly explain your issue and what you're trying to accomplish.
2. ✅ List what you’ve already tried.
3. ✅ Provide minimal, reproducible code samples (but do not attach your entire project).

## ❌ What NOT to Do

When seeking support, please avoid the following:

1. 🚫 Do not message contributors on Twitter or other social media.
2. 🚫 Do not spam issues with +1 comments or duplicate issues.

Public questions get public answers, which benefit everyone in the community. Let’s keep discussions open and helpful! ✌️
